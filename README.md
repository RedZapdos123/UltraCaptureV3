# UltraCaptureV3 - Advanced CAPTCHA Recognition Web Application:

A modern, retro-styled web application for recognizing CAPTCHA images using a hybrid CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) architecture with attention mechanisms. The application features CPU-based ONNX inference for fast, cross-platform deployment without GPU requirements.

## Features:

- **High Accuracy**: Achieves **95.08% Character Accuracy** and **86.37% Sequence Accuracy** on test sets.
- **Advanced Architecture**: Hybrid CRNN combining ResNet-style CNN backbone, CBAM attention, Bi-LSTM, and Transformer Encoder.
- **CPU-Based Inference**: Uses ONNX Runtime for fast, optimized CPU inference (30-100ms per image) without GPU requirements.
- **Retro/Vintage Design**: Beautiful single-page application with retro aesthetic, dark/light theme toggle, and responsive layout.
- **Easy Deployment**: Simple setup with PowerShell scripts for automated environment configuration.
- **Web-Based Interface**: Intuitive drag-and-drop image upload with real-time predictions and inference timing.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux with Python 3.11+ and Node.js.

## Model Architecture:

The model is a custom-built Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) that integrates multiple advanced concepts for maximum accuracy:

- **Stage 1 - Feature Extraction**: Deep CNN with ResNet-style residual blocks enhanced with CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) for channel and spatial attention.
- **Stage 2 - Sequence Modeling**: Bidirectional LSTM processes feature sequences, refined by Transformer Encoder for long-range dependencies.
- **Loss Function**: Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) for unsegmented sequence learning.

**Key Specifications:**
- Input Size: 64Ã—256 pixels (RGB).
- Hidden Size: 512.
- Attention Heads: 8.
- Transformer Layers: 4.
- Charset: 62 characters (0-9, A-Z, a-z).
- Model Size: ~273MB (ONNX format).

## Dataset and Performance:

### Dataset:

The model was trained on the **Huge CAPTCHA Dataset** that's been made by the author, **Mridankan Mandal**, which has been made available on Kaggle. This dataset contains a large number of CAPTCHA images with alphanumeric characters, where the label for each image is its filename.

### Performance Metrics:

The model achieves high accuracy on both the validation and unseen test sets.

| Metric             | Validation Set | Test Set |
| ------------------ | :------------: | :------: |
| Sequence Accuracy  |     86.4%      | 86.37%   |
| Character Accuracy |     95.1%      | 95.08%   |

## ðŸš€ Quick Start:

### Prerequisites:

- **Python** 3.11 (recommended) or 3.8+.
- **Node.js** 18.0 or higher.
- **Git** (optional, for cloning the repository).

### Installation (Automated):

The easiest way to set up the application is using the provided PowerShell script:

```powershell
.\setup.ps1
```

This script will automatically:
- Check for Python and Node.js installation.
- Create a Python virtual environment.
- Install all backend dependencies (ONNX Runtime, Flask, etc.).
- Install all frontend dependencies.
- Verify the ONNX model exists.

### Running the Application:

Start both the backend and frontend servers with:

```powershell
.\start.ps1
```

Then open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5173
```
